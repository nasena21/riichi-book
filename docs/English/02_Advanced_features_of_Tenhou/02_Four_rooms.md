# 2.2 Four rooms

As we have seen, there are four diﬀerent rooms where ranking
matches are played. Qualiﬁcations to play in each room are based
on your rank and R.

## 1. 一般(ippan; lower-level room)

This is the only room where you can play initially. Players with an R higher than 1800 and a rank higher than 四段are not allowed to play here, however. Games in this room can sometimes be a bit random, even chaotic at times. Some of the players in this room probably do not understand the rules very well. You very rarely come across strong players here.

## 2. 上級(joukyu; upper-level room)

You can play here if (1) your rank is 1 級or higher or (2) you buy a two-month membership (¥ 1080 = e 8 = £ 6).[^3] Players with an R higher than 2000 and a rank higher than 七段are not allowed to play in this room, however.

Games in the joukyu room are more reasonable than those in the lower-level room, but you still see many players who do not defend at all, do meaningless dama / unreasonable riichi, and make serious mistakes in maximizing tile eﬃciency. In my impression, games at EMA tournaments most resemble games in the ippan and joukyu rooms.

## 3. 特上 (tokujou; advanced room)

Requirements to play in this room are pretty demanding. You have to have a 四段 or higher rank and a 1800 or higher R. The latter requirement is particularly diﬃcult to satisfy for intermediate players. As I wrote above, achieving the rank of 四段 is not that diﬃcult, but satisfying the R $\geq$  1800 condition requires that you take mahjong rather seriously. Since weak players are shut out from the tokujou room, games in tokujou are qualitatively diﬀerent from those in the joukyu and ippan rooms. Games in this room feel similar to those you’d experience at regular フリー (furii) mahjong parlors in Japan.

## 4. 鳳凰 (houou; phoenix room)

This is the highest-level room in Tenhou. In order to play in this room, you have to have all of the following: (1) a 七段 or higher rank, (2) a 2000 or higher R, and (3) a paid membership (¥ 540 yen = e 4 = £ 3 per month). Satisfying the ﬁrst two conditions can be really, really challenging.

This is arguably one of the highest-level mahjong locales in the whole world. It is not uncommon for you to come across a hououlevel player at a regular mahjong parlor in Japan. However, you usually play against at most one houou-level player at a table, and the two other players at the table are either tokujou- or joukyu-level players. What is remarkable about games in the houou room is that you will be surrounded by three other houou-level players. It would be safe to say that no other public mahjong locale in the world — whether it is online or offine — could oﬀer a comparable experience.[^4]

[^4]: Perhaps the highest-level leagues in professional mahjong associations in Japan have players who are of comparable quality, but you have to become a professional player to play at such leagues. Even after becoming a professional, you will need at least a few years to reach the highest league.
