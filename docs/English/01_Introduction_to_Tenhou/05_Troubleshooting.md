# Troubleshooting


At times, you may get disconnected from the Tenhou server (pos-
sibly because of poor internet connection on your end or problems
on the server).6 When a player gets disconnected from the server
during a game, the game still continues. The “auto discard draw”
will be turned on for the disconnected player, so they will be simply
discarding anything they draw until they return. The player name
will turn into dark red once a player is disconnected.

When you get disconnected,
you may get a warning mes-
sage shown above, asking you
if you would like to get con-
nected again. Click Yes if you
want to. However, a warning
message does not always show up when you get disconnected. When
a screen freezes during a game for more than 15 seconds, you should
suspect that you are disconnected. You may want to hit the refresh
button on your browser to get connected to the server again.

You can create more than one accounts on Tenhou, but you will
have to wait for 7 days unless your IP address changes. If you at-
tempt to create a second account from the same IP address within
7 days, you will get an error message shown below, telling you that
you cannot create a new account from your IP address in 7 days.

## Footnotes

You will notice that players sometimes get disconnected on purpose to quit
playing, especially when they are losing badly.
