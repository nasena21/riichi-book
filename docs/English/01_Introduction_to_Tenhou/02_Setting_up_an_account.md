# 1.2 Setting up an account

One of the challenges for European players in setting up an account on Tenhou would be that almost everything is written in Japanese. However, you will only need a minimal level of Japanese to get by, and this chapter will walk you through the process.

First, go to the Tenhou webpage [http://tenhou.net/](http://tenhou.net/).

Scroll down and click either the PLAY button (to play in a pop-up window) or a link just below the button (to play in the current window) that reads <u>このウィンドウで開く</u>.

Then, on the next page (either in a pop-up window or in the current window), you’ll see something like the following:

The bottom line will initially read LOADING... / 再読み込み, but in a few seconds it will change into »Flash 版 サ ー バ に 接 続 | Web 版 β サーバに接続. Then, click on the Flash サーバに接続 link if you are accessing from a ﬂash-capable device such as your PC; alternatively, click on the Web 版 β サ ー バ に 接 続 link if you are accessing from a smart phone or tablet. If it doesn’t change into »Flash 版 サ ー バ に 接 続 | Web 版 β サ ー バ に 接 続 within 10 seconds or so, you may want to click on the 再 読 み 込 み link right next to LOADING, which will prompt the browser to reload the page. Clicking on either of the Flash/Web サーバに接続 links will take you to the log-in entrance of Tenhou. Explanations below are based on the Flash version.

When you ﬁrst visit this page, the ID ﬁeld right next to the 新 規 ID 登 録 button is likely to be blank, as shown in the picture above. This is because you haven’t registered an account. In order to create an account, click on the 新 規 ID 登 録 (New ID Registration) button on the left.

A pop-up message will show up, warning you that whatever ID that is currently shown in the ID ﬁeld (if any) will be overwritten with a new ID and that you may want to copy and paste the current ID (if any) into some text ﬁle or similar. Do so if you do see an old ID in the ID ﬁeld, just to be safe. If the ID ﬁeld is blank, just click the Yes button, which will open yet another pop-up message.

It is telling you the following:

- You can create a player ID for free, and doing so is necessary if
you want to earn a rank (kyuu / dan) and rating.
- Some characters or character combinations are not allowed in
player names.
- Once you register, you cannot register another account for a
given period (7 days).
- If you don’t play for 180 days, your ID may be deleted.
- A player name must have 1-8 characters.

Type in a player name you’d like to have (8 characters or fewer) into the blank ﬁeld at the bottom and click OK. You cannot change your player name later, so choose wisely. If the player name you type in is already taken by another player, it gives you an error message, as follows:

Click OK, and type in another name. If successful, you’ll see a new message asking you to conﬁrm that you want to register an account with the player name provided.

Click Yes and you’ll see another message as follows:

The 19-digit alpha-numeric code that starts with “ID” (shown in white on a black background) is your unique player ID (it is ID12345678ABCDEFGH in the picture above). I suggest you save your ID in a text ﬁle or something so that you don’t lose it. They cannot re-issue your player ID (unless you have a paid membership and hold a rank of 七段 or higher).

Clicking OK will take you back to the log-in entrance page, but this time you should see your player ID in the ID ﬁeld.

You can make several choices before entering the main page. First,
you can choose male or female voice (for pon / chii / riichi, etc.) by
clicking on the button right next to the ID ﬁeld. You can choose a
diﬀerent gender each time you log in to the main lobby. Second, you
can choose プレミアム (premium) or エコノミー (economy) version.
The premium version has better graphics, so I suggest you choose
the premium version.

If you are happy with your choices, you can enter the main page
by clicking on the OK button on the right.
