# 1.1 Why play online

Playing mahjong online is an excellent way to practice your mahjong skills. You don’t need any mahjong equipment to play; you don’t need to coordinate with your mahjong friends to find the time and place that work for all four of you. You can simply open your computer and access one of many online mahjong platforms. As long as you have an internet connection, you can play mahjong any time, anywhere, and for any length of time.

Another advantage of online playing is that you can easily keep the record of your playing history and obtain detailed statistics from all the games you play. Analyzing these statistics will help you identify what skill sets you need to work on. You can also show your game record to your friends and ask for their opinions about particular choices you’ve made in a game.
