# Rules

Here is a summary of the rules on Tenhou.
- Three red ﬁves (one in each suit) in games with red ﬁves.
- No kuikae (swap-calling). That is, you cannot discard an identical
tile after pon or chii. You cannot discard the tile from other
end of the run, either.
- “Sudden death” rule when no player has 30000 or more points
after South-4 (East-4 in East-only games).
- A game is terminated when a player goes bankrupt.
- Automatic agariyame rule (i.e., the game is automatically terminated
if the dealer is leading after the end of South-4, even if
he won a hand in South-4).
- One-han minimum all the time (i.e., no two-han minimum even
after ﬁve counters).
- Abortive draw in the following situations:
– 九種九牌 (nine terminals / honors)
– 四家立直 (four riichi’s)
– 三家和了 (three players call ron on a discard)
– 四風子連打 (four players discard the same wind)
– 四槓散了 (four kan by diﬀerent players)
- 流し満貫 (nagashi mangan) is allowed. You can declare it even
when you have called pon / chii. You cannot declare it if one
or more of your discards has been called by others.

- Up to two players can win on a discard. riichi bets and counter
bonus go to the player sitting closer to the player who discarded
the winning tile. The dealership remains if the dealer is one of
the winners.
- The following are recognized as yakuman: 天 和 (Tenhou; Blessing
of Heaven) / 地和 (chihou; Blessing of Earth) / 大三元 (daisangen;
Big Three Dragons) / 四暗刻 (su anko; Four Concealed Pungs)
/ 四暗刻単騎 (su anko tanki; Single-Wait Four Concealed Pungs)
/ 字一色 (tsuiisou; All Honors) / 緑一色 (ryuiisou; All Green)
/ 清老頭 (chinroutou; All Terminals) / 国士無双 (kokushi muso;
Thirteen Orphans) / 国士無双 13 面 (Thirteen-wait Thirteen Orphans)
/ 大四喜 (daisushi; Big Four Winds) / 小四喜 (shosushi;
Little Four Winds) / 四槓子 (su kantsu; Four Kongs) / 九蓮宝燈
(churenpoutou; Nine Gates) / 純正九蓮宝燈 (junsei churenpoutou;
Nine-wait Nine Gates).
- Yakuman can be combined. For example, 大三元 (Big Three Dragons)
can be combined with 字 一 色 (All Honors), 四 暗 刻 (Four
Concealed Pungs), and either of 四槓子 (Four Kongs), 天和 (Blessing
of Heaven) or 地和 (Blessing of Earth), producing a quadruple
yakuman (128000 points).
- There is no double yakuman unless diﬀerent yakuman are combined.
For example, 国士無双 (Thirteen Orphans) and 国士無双
13 面 (Thirteen-wait Thirteen Orphans) are both single yakuman.
- You cannot call pon / chii / kan on the last discard in a hand.
- Sekinin barai: a player who feeds the third Dragon pon / kan
to an opponent with two melded Dragon pon / kan must pay
the full value of the hand in case Big Three Dragons is made on
a self-draw. In case another player deals into it, the two share the payment equally. The same rule applies to Big Four Winds,
but not to rinshan kaihou (After a Kong).
