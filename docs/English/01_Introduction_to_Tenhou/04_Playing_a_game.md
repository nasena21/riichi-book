# 1.4 Playing a game


![tigaratus](/assets/image/image_15.png){ align=right }

Once a slot becomes available for you, you will be taken to a game table along with three other players. A black pop-up screen (see right) will appear. The game will start in 10 seconds (if all the four players click on the OK button, the game will start immediately). Each player is randomly assigned to East, West, South, or North. In the example above, my initial seat wind is North (北).



The Tenhou interface is quite intuitive so you won’t need much instruction. Once a hand begins, tiles are dealt automatically. You also automatically draw a tile when your turn comes. In each turn, click on the tile you want to discard.

Each action is timed. At a standard (non fast) table, you have 5 seconds to discard a tile. In addition, you are given a total allowance of 10 seconds in each hand. That is, even when you use up the 5 seconds allocated to you in a particular turn, you will be given the maximum 10 additional seconds (minus the seconds you have already used up in previous turns in the hand). For example, when you use 5 + 4 seconds in the ﬁrst turn, the remaining allowance reduces to 10 - 4 = 6 seconds in this hand. Therefore, the next time you use up the ﬁrst 5 seconds, you will be given only 6 more seconds. The allowance will increase by 1 second (up to 10 seconds) each time you make your discard choice in less than 1 second. The allowance will revert to 10 seconds when the next hand begins. At fast tables, each action must be done in 3 seconds, with a total allowance of 5 seconds.



## 1.4.1 Calling / melding
When a call becomes available, a box with a call name will show
up to prompt your reaction. The call prompts are written in Japanese.
The good news is that they are relatively simple and easy to guess
from the context. It would be enough to memorize the following
eight mahjong words in Japanese.

### 1. Riichi (リーチ)


You can call riichi when you have (1) a closed ready hand, (2) at least 1000 points left, and (3) at least one turn left to draw. When all of the three conditions are met, a translucent box that reads リ ー チ in white letters will pop up in your turn.

![Image 6](/assets/image/image_17.png)

If you want to riichi, you must click on the リーチ box ﬁrst, then click on the tile you want to discard. Once you click on the リーチ box, you cannot call it off. Clicking on the リーチ box also makes it impossible to discard a tile that does not make the hand ready. In the above example, tiles other than ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-man.png)
![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/6-man.png)
![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/8-man.png)
![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png)   will become unclickable once you click on the リーチ box. If you do not want to call riichi, just click on the tile you want to discard.

### 2. Ron (ロン)

A ロ ン box will pop up whenever you can legitimately declare ron on an opponent’s discard. In other words, chombo is made impossible on Tenhou. For example, when you are furiten, a ロ ン box will not pop up because you cannot legally ron with a furiten hand. Whenever your hand is in a furiten status, it is indicated with a フ リ テ ン (furiten) sign in small translucent letters below your hand that looks like: ![dalamgaris](/assets/image/image_18.png). If you don’t click on the ロ ン box in time
(i.e., in 5 or 3 seconds + allowance), it is assumed that you pass.

### 3. パス Pass (do nothing)

Whenever a ロン box pops up, another box that reads パス (pass) will accompany it.

![Image 6](/assets/image/image_19.png)

Click on the パ ス box immediately if you don’t want to declare ron on a discard. You would not want to pause for too long because that can look suspicious. A パス box will also pop up when other calling actions become available.

### 4. Tsumo (ツモ)

A ツモ box will pop up when you can legitimately declare tsumo with your draw.

### 5. Pon (ポン)

When calling pon becomes available, a ポン box will pop up right above the tiles in your hand with which to call pon. A パ ス box will also pop up. If you want to call pon, mouse over the tiles in your hand with which to call pon. Then the candidate tiles will stick out, as follows:

![Image 6](/assets/image/image_20.png)

Click on them to call pon. If you click on the パ ス box or don’t do anything in time, it is assumed that you pass.

### 6. Chii (チー)

Chii calls are done in a similar way. When it becomes available, a small sign that reads チー will pop up right above the tiles in your hand with which to call chii.

![small](/assets/image/image_21.png)



When you have multiple sets of tiles with which to chii, as is the case in the above picture, mouse over the candidate tiles to choose. In the picture above, the left player discarded a   ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/6-pin.png) and you can chii it with either  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png)![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png),  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png)![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png), or  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png)![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/8-pin.png).  If you want to chii it with  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png)![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png),  mouse over the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png)  then the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png)  and the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) will stick out so you can click on them.  If you want to chii it with  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png)![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png),  mouse over the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png)  then the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png)  and the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png) will stick out so you can click on them.  Finally, if you want to chii it with  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png)![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/8-pin.png),  mouse over the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png)  then the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png)  and the  ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/8-pin.png) will stick out so you can click on them.  



### 7. Kan (カン)

Calling kan on a discard is similar to calling pon. Calling kan by extending a melded pon may be a little bit confusing at ﬁrst. When you have a melded pon and there is the fourth tile in your hand (newly drawn or previously drawn), a small sign that reads カ ン will appear below the pon upon your turn. If you want to extend the melded pon, mouse over the melded pon then the fourth tile will stick out. Click on the melded pon to extend the pon. To call a concealed kan, mouse over the four tiles you want to kan then the tiles will stick out, accompanied by a small sign that reads カ ン below them. Click on them to call kan.

### 8. 九種九牌 Kyuushu Kyuuhai

When you have nine different terminals and honors after the ﬁrst draw in an uninterrupted ﬁrst set of turns, you can declare an abortive draw. When this becomes available, a box that reads 九 種 九 牌 will pop up. Click on it if you want to declare an abortive draw. If you wish to continue with the hand, just click on the tile you want to discard.

### Multiple boxes

Sometimes you have multiple choices as to what to do with a given discard of your opponent. In the following example, you have a ready hand waiting for ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/2-man.png)-![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-man.png), and the left player discarded a ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-man.png).  

You will be given the following three choices:

![Image 6](/assets/image/image_22.png)

- Call ron
- Call chii
- Pass (do nothing)

To call ron on the discarded ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/5-man.png), click on the ロン (ron) box that pops up above your hand. If you want to do nothing, click on the パス (pass) box right next to the ロン box. Alternatively, if you want to call chii, mouse over the two tiles you want to chii with (in this case ![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/3-man.png)![singletile](/assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)) and click on them.

## 1.4.2 Buttons

The buttons at the bottom right corner allow you to toggle on/offsome calling-related features. Each feature is turned off at the beginningof a new hand.

![small](/assets/image/image_23.png)

### 自動和了 (Auto call win)

If you turn this on, you will automatically win a hand when possible without clicking on ロン or ツモ boxes. In other words, the option of passing is unavailable when this is turned on. Keep in mind that this can be problematic at times when you intend not to win your hand from a particular opponent or on a particular tile. When this is turned on, the word 自動和了 is shown in white; when it is turned off, it is translucent. In the picture above, it is turned on.

### ツモ切り (Auto discard draw)

If you turn this on, you will automatically discard whatever tile you draw. Turn this on when you have to go to toilet or somewhere but don’t want to quit the game entirely. When you riichi, this feature is automatically (and implicitly) turned on. In the picture above, it is turned oﬀ.

### 鳴かない (No call)

If you turn this on, you will not be prompted to call chii, pon, or kan. This feature is useful for hiding information about your hand’s tile composition from your opponents. If you pause every time someone discards a certain tile you can call, your opponents might be able to guess what pairs of tiles you have and don’t have. Drawing a deduction from such time lags constitutes an important skill in Tenhou. However, in order not to disadvantage players waiting to call chii / pon too much, time lags will also occur randomly (i.e., even when no one can call pon / chii on the discarded tile).

### 画 (Picture) and 音 (Sound effect)

You can change the appearance of the tiles and/or mat or resize the window with the Picture button. You can turn on/oﬀ the sound eﬀect (for riichi, chii, pon, etc.) with the Sound button.

## 1.4.3 Scoring
When a player wins a hand, the score will be calculated automatically. A scoring board will pop up that shows the hand, dora (and ura dora if riichi was declared), yaku names and the associated number of han, minipoints, and the total hand value.

![Image 6](/assets/image/image_24.png)

In the example above, the left player dealt into my hand that is worth 60 符 (fu; minipoints) 13 飜 (han) = 32000 点 (points). Yaku names will be shown in Japanese along with han counts. Table 1.2 at the end of this chapter lists all the yaku names Tenhou recognizes.

## 1.4.4 Indicators
The black rectangular board in the middle of the screen provides information about the proceeding of the game.

![Image 6](/assets/image/image_25.png)

We can see that this is South-4, there is 0 counter and 0 riichi bet, and it is the North player’s turn. The West player is leading (44000 points), followed by the East player (26800), the North player (17400), and the South player (11800). Each player’s rank (kyuu / dan) is shown right next to their points.



![Image 6](/assets/image/image_26.png)

If you mouse over the middle board, you will see the current point differences between you and each of your opponents. In the present example, the West player has 44000 - 26800 = +17200 more points than I do. If you are leading against another player, the point difference will be negative. For example, the South player has 11800 so the point difference is 11800 - 26800 = - 15000.

It is important to pay close attention to these point differences, es- pecially in the South round or when one of your opponents is at the risk of bankruptcy. In the current example, if the East player wins a 12000 hand from the South player, South will go bankrupt and the game is terminated. Notice that East is currently ranked second, having 17200 points fewer than West. In this case, winning a 12000 from South is not ideal for East because East will still be ranked second and the game is over.[^5]


You can also see the type of game you are currently playing on the board. Just below the wall opposite to you is an indicator that looks like this: ![dalamgaris](/assets/image/image_27.png).

- The ﬁrst letter indicates the room: 般 for 一般 (ippan), 上 for 上 級 (joukyuu), 特 for 特 上 (tokujou), 鳳 for 鳳 凰 (houou). See Chapter 2 for explanations of these. 
- The second letter indicates if it is an East-only game ( 東) or an East–South ( 南) game. 
- The third letter indicates if open tanyao is allowed: 喰 (with open tanyao) or 無 (without open tanyao) 
- A fourth letter ( 赤) is added if there are red ﬁves. 
- A ﬁfth letter ( 速) is added if it is a fast game.

## 1.4.5 Ending of a game
A game can end in several different ways.

- One or more player goes bankrupt (below 0 points). 
- South-4 (East-4 in East-only games) ends and at least one player has 30000 or more points. 
- West-4 (South-4 in East-only games) ends. 
- At any point in the West round (South round in East-only games), at least one player has 30000 or more points.


When a game ends, ﬁnal scores are calculated as follows.

- In cases of a tie, the player sitting closer to the ﬁrst dealer wins. 
- Oka (winning premium) is 20000. That is, although every player is allocated 25000 points at the beginning of a game, they have to return 30000 at the end of the game, meaning that 30000 will be subtracted from the ﬁnal raw scores. The residual points of 20000 = (30000 - 25000) x 4 are awarded to the winner of the game. 
- Uma (placement bonus) is 10-20. That is, 1st player gets +20000, 2nd player gets +10000, 3rd player gets - 10000, and 4th player gets - 20000. 
- Each score is then scaled by dividing it by 1000 and rounding it off.

It appears that European players are not very familiar with the oka system (possibly because there is no oka in EMA rules), so let me explain this with an example. Suppose that players A, B, C, and D hold the following raw points at the end of a game; 39000, 25100, 22900, and 13000, as shown in Table 1.1 below.


Table 1.1: Final score calculation on Tenhou

| Player | Raw score | Before uma | After uma | After oka |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| A      | 39000     | 9000        | 29000     | 49000     |
| B      | 25100     | -4900       | 5100      | 5100      |
| C      | 22900     | -7100       | -17100    | -17100    |
| D      | 13000     | -17000      | -37000    | -37000    |



The ﬁrst numerical column shows the raw scores. Then, 30000 is subtracted from each of the raw scores (second column). Then, we add uma to each score based on placements (third column). Finally, we add oka to the winner’s score to obtain the ﬁnal scores (fourth column).

![tigaratus](/assets/image/image_28.png){ align=right }

The ﬁnal scores after adding uma and oka and scaling will be displayed along with the placements and raw scores. In the example to the right of this text, I ( 私 means “me”) came in 1st, earning 50100 points (60.0 with uma and oka), 2nd player (C さん, which reads Mr. C) earns 46000 points (+ 26.0 with uma), 3rd player earns 6700 points ( -33.0 with uma), and 4th player went bankrupt (-2800 points, -53.0 with uma).

## Notes on placement
It is important to keep in mind that your rank and rating on Tenhou depend solely on the placement in a game and not on how many points you earn in a game, before or after adding uma and oka. In other words, there is absolutely no difference between getting 1st place with 30000 points and getting 1st place with, say, 80000 points in terms of their contributions to your rank and rating.[^a] 

This feature adds an interesting strategic element to the game. That is, it makes it clearer that the goal of mahjong is not to win a hand per se but to have a better placement at the end of a game. Winning a hand is just one of several means to securing a good placement. On occasion, you may ﬁnd it beneﬁcial to assist one of your opponents instead of trying to win a hand yourself. Intentionally dealing into an opponent’s hand can sometimes be a good tactic when it serves the purpose of securing your own placement.

In my impression, many European players are lacking the appreciation of this aspect of mahjong. I hope you will learn to appreciate it through playing lots of games on Tenhou.


## Footnotes

[^5]: As we will see later, avoiding the fourth place is more important in Tenhou rules
than it is in other rules. However, this does not mean that it is your only priority;
you would still want to improve your placement in a game when doing so is a
realistic possibility.


[^a]: You might wonder why they still calculate the ﬁnal scores with uma and oka in Tenhou if they are irrelevant; I honestly have no idea.
