# The ﬁve-block method

In introducing basic building blocks of riichi mahjong in the previous chapter, I have also touched upon a number of important tile eﬃciency principles — e.g., superiority of side-wait protoruns, the value of having two pairs in a hand rather than three, and the value of stretched single or bulging ﬂoat shapes, to name a few.

These principles are all important, but trying to take all of the important principles into consideration at once could be a daunting task. We have to make our discard choice in a limited amount of time,[^1] and tile eﬃciency is not the only factor we need to consider in making a discard choice. Moreover, some of the tile eﬃciency prin- ciples can at times clash with one another, requiring us to make a judgement call about which principle to follow. For example, we may at times wonder whether to retain a bulging ﬂoat shape or to retain two pairs in a hand, when we have to discard one of the two.

The ﬁve-block method I introduce in this chapter will help us prioritize between competing principles and ﬁnd the most eﬃcient discard choice quickly.[^2] The core idea of the ﬁve-block method is deceptively simple; we ﬁrst identify ﬁve tile blocks in a hand — four groups + one head, or their candidates — and try to complete each block.
