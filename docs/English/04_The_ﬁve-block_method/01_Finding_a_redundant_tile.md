# 4.1 Finding a redundant tile

We all understand that a standard hand must have ﬁve blocks of tiles — four groups and one head — to win. The ﬁve-block method encourages us to be always conscious about ﬁve tile blocks in a hand. Consider the following hand. What would you discard and why?

To ﬁgure out which tile is the least useful in this hand, let’s divide
the hand into tile blocks, as follows.

Notice that, although we do not know which block is going to be the head and which blocks are going to be four groups at the moment, the hand already has ﬁve tile blocks. This means that there is no need to increase or decrease the number of blocks from here.

Looking at each of the ﬁve blocks, the pair of ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png), the protorun ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-man.png), and the set of ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/chun.png) are all self-sufficient; we keep them as they are. Our discard choice should thus be from the third or the fourth blocks, ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) or ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-sou.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png). Let’s now compare these two closedwait blocks. While ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-sou.png) is being useful within the block it belongs to, enabling the hand to accept ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-sou.png), ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)is completely redundant; the hand can accept ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png) without having ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png). Therefore, the ideal discard here is ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png).

<br>

There are two key points to remember in applying the ﬁve-block method. First, we should not make any one of the ﬁve blocks “too weak.”[^3] In the current example, if we discard ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png), the ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-sou.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png) block becomes an isolated closed-wait protorun, which is too weak compared with the other blocks. Likewise, if we discard ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-sou.png), this block becomes a pair of ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png). Since this hand already has two other pairs, having a third pair makes all the pairs in the hand too weak.

<br>

Second, each of the ﬁve tile blocks should ideally have three tiles. In the current example, the ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-sou.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png) block has exactly three tiles and so we should not choose a discard from this block. On the other hand, the ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) block currently has four tiles so we should discard one from this block to make this a three-tile block.

    Identify ﬁve tile blocks in a hand. Try to make sure:
    <br>
    (1) there is no block that is too weak; and
    <br>
    (2) each block has at most three tiles.

Let’s see another example.

We can easily see that there is one block in manzu (cracks), two blocks
in pinzu (dots), and a pair of white dragons, giving us four blocks.
This means that we need to have only one more block in souzu (bamboos).
Therefore, we divide the hand as follows.

<fieldset class="no-border">
<legend>(4.2)</legend>
<div class="garisbawah">
    <div class="empty-container">

Since we should not create a block that is too weak, discarding ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png)‌ or ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png) is not an option. Notice that the block in souzu (bamboos) has four tiles. We should thus discard one from this block. In case the pair of white dragon later becomes a set, we should keep the pair of ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/9-sou.png), leaving ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-sou.png) or ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-sou.png) as a discard candidate. Given that ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-sou.png) has a higher chance of creating a side-wait protorun, we should discard ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-sou.png). Then, none of the ﬁve blocks is too weak, and each block has at most three tiles.

<br>

In the two examples we saw above, you might have been able to identify the redundant tiles without really thinking too hard. If so, that was probably because you have implicitly and unconsciously applied the ﬁve-block method in your mind. The goal of this chapter is to train our mind further, so that it becomes our second nature to identify ﬁve tile blocks in a hand.

## Footnotes
[^3]: Basically, any block that is weaker than a side-wait protorun is a weak block.
