# 3.3 Complex shapes

The three basic types of tile blocks we have covered so far — groups (runs and sets), protoruns (side wait, closed wait, and edge wait), and pairs — form the basis of any standard mahjong hands.[^13] When a hand has some tiles that do not constitute any of these three shapes, we treat them as **floating tiles**. For example, ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) and ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-sou.png) in the following hand are both floating tiles.

In addition to these basic blocks, we often come across complex shapes that are made up of two or more groups, protoruns, pairs, and floating tiles combined. It is useful to comprehend such com- plex shapes as they are rather than breaking them up into smaller parts. We will discuss three-tile complex shapes and four-tile complex shapes in turn.

## 3.3.1 Three-tile complex shapes

There are two kinds of three-tile complex shapes — double closed shape and protorun plus one shape.

### Double closed (ryankan) shape

When two closed-wait protoruns are combined, we have a **double closed** (ryankan) shape. There are ﬁve diﬀerent patterns in each suit, as follows.

</div>


Each shape accepts as many as 2 kinds–8 tiles. For example, ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-sou.png)![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png)![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-sou.png)  accepts ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-sou.png) (4 tiles) and ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-sou.png) (4 tiles). This is twice as many as the  number of tiles an isolated closed-wait protorun can accept.

Sometimes a double closed shape is embedded within a tile block, making it diﬃcult to detect it. For example, consider the following 1-away hand.

<div class="discard-question">What would you discard?</div>

</fieldset>

Before drawing ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png), the hand was already in a very good shape. It was perfect 1-away, accepting any of ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-sou.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-sou.png) (6 kinds–19 tiles). The question is whether we should keep  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) and discard ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) instead.

Notice that, if we keep ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png), we have a double closed shape ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-pin.png) . This is because the block ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png) can be split into ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-pin.png) and ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png). If we keep ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) and discard ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png), the hand is still 1-away from ready, accepting ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-pin.png) (5 kinds–19 tiles). The benefit of discarding  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) to keep the double closed shape is that the hand can *always* be pinfu when it is ready. On the other hand, discarding  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) means that the hand may become a yaku-less hand when drawing ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) or ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-sou.png).

Double closed shapes are particularly useful when a hand is rel- atively far from ready (2-away or worse). As a hand advances, however, its usefulness diminishes because this block requires three (not two) tiles even though it is not a complete group. Moreover, it will ultimately become a single closed-wait protorun when this block remains incomplete when the hand is ready. Therefore, we should not rely too much on a double closed shape. For example, consider the following two hands.

Both hands are 1-away from ready and both contain a double  closed shape in souzu (bamboos) tiles. Maintaining the double closed hape in these cases will not be ideal. It is true that, if the hand becomes  ready by drawing ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-sou.png)  or  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-sou.png) first, each of the hands makes for  a good-wait ready hand. However, if the first hand becomes ready  by calling pon on ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/chun.png) or the second hand becomes ready by drawing ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-man.png) or ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) first, they only make for a closed-wait ready hand.  

Therefore, when we draw a tile next to the head, creating a side-  wait protorun, we should keep it and break the double closed shape  instead. In the first example above, as we draw ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-man.png) that creates a side-wait  protorun ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png), we should keep it and discard the ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-sou.png) instead.  

In the second example above, as we draw ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png) that creates a side-wait  protorun ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-pin.png), we should keep it and discard  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-sou.png) instead.


### Protorun plus one shape

As we saw with the first example in Section 3.2.8, we often come across a tile combination such as ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png)  that is made up with one  protorun plus one floating tile (  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png)  +  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png)). [^14] Depending on the type of protoruns, we can classify protorun plus one shapes into three types, as summarized in Table 3.2.

Table 3.2: Types of protorun plus one shapes




| Name        | Example                                                                 | Wait                                     | Acceptance       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|
| side wait   | ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png)![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png)![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) | ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-man.png)-![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) | 3 kinds–10 tiles |
| closed wait | ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) | ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)  ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png)              | 2 kinds–6 tiles  |
| edge wait   | ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-sou.png)![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-sou.png)![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/9-sou.png) | ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-sou.png)  ![tsingletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-sou.png)             | 2 kinds–6 tiles  |

A protorun plus one can accept two additional tiles that an iso- lated protorun cannot. This is because these blocks can now be a candidate for a set as well as for a run.


Breaking a protorun plus one can be inefficient. For example, if  we break a closed wait plus one shape into an isolated pair (i.e., discard  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png)  from  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png)), the tile acceptance decreases from 6 to 2; it  can accept only  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png) (1 kind–2 tiles). Similarly, if we break it into an  isolated protorun (i.e., discard  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)  from  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png)), the tile acceptance  decreases from 6 to 4; it can accept only  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png) (1 kind–4 tiles). With this  in mind, consider the following hand.

Discarding ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) or  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png) to break the protorun plus one  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png) is inefficient  here. Discarding  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) decreases tile acceptance by two, and discarding  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png) decreases tile acceptance by four. Moreover, discarding  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png) leaves three pairs in this hand, which should be avoided. Discarding  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/9-sou.png)  is much more efficient.

Sometimes we have to make a choice between multiple protorun plus one shapes, just like we did in examples in Section 3.2.8. Consider the following hand. What would you discard?

There are two protorun plus one shapes in this hand: ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png) and![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png)![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png)![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png). We have to break one of the two into either an isolated Pair or an isolated protorun, because the other parts of this hand are more or less self-sufficient. Which one should we choose?

When choosing between which protoruns plus one to break, priority should be given to the weaker one. Since the side-wait protorun  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) is much stronger than the closed-wait protorun  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png), we should prioritize the latter and maintain  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png).  In other words, the  side-wait protorun  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) is so strong that we do not need to provide  a cover by maintaining the "plus one" tile,  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png).  On the other hand,  the closed-wait protorun  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png) is weaker so we should cover it by  keeping another  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) as a back-up. You should thus discard  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png).

## 3.3.2 Four-tile complex shapes
Among several diﬀerent kinds of four-tile complex shapes, we will focus on those that are made up of one group and one floating tile. There are three variants of this kind — stretched single, bulging float, and skipping.

### Stretched Single (Nobetan) Shape

A set of four consecutive tiles such as  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) is called a **stretched  single** (nobetan) shape. Stretched single shapes are very useful both  when a hand is ready and when a hand is 1-away or worse.

When a stretched single shape is in a ready hand, that part forms  the wait of the hand. For example, the following hand is ready, waiting  for  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-man.png)  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png).


<fieldset class="mahjong-group">

In a ready hand, the stretched single shape can be thought of as a candidate for the head (![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-man.png) or ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png)) and a candidate for a run ( ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) or ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png)‌). For example, if we win this hand on ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-man.png) , then ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-man.png) becomes the head, and ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) becomes a run. On the other hand, if we win this hand on ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png), then ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) becomes the head, and ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/1-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png)‌ becomes a run.


Another important role that a stretched single shape can play is to work as a candidate for two runs. When a hand is 1-away or worse, we can count on a stretched single shape to produce two runs. For example, consider a stretched single shape ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-pin.png).

There are six patterns of stretched single shapes, from 1234 through 6789. Table 3.3 summarizes the tiles each shape can accept to produce various waits.

As we can see, the middle two ones — 3456 and 4567 — are the most versatile. They can accept two diﬀerent tiles to produce a 3-way wait (27 or 38), two diﬀerent tiles to produce a 2-way side wait (45 or 56), and two diﬀerent tiles to produce a 1-way wait (18 or 29 to produce a closed wait). The 3456 and 4567 shapes are the most valuable of all four-tile shapes, and we should not lightly break such shapes when a hand is far away from ready. With this in mind, consider the following 2-away hand.

It is true that discarding ‌![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) or  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png) would lead to the greatest tile acceptance (7 kinds–24 tiles) temporarily. However, doing so is too myopic. If we do that, all the remaining protoruns will be closed-wait or edge-wait ones. We should rather discard ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/9-sou.png) to keep the 3456 shape, which we can expect to produce two side-wait protoruns later. The resulting tile acceptance (6 kinds–20 tiles) is not much smaller, either.

<fieldset class="redline">

Try to keep a stretched single shape if a hand has one. In particular, 3456 and 4567 should be kept until the hand becomes ready or 1-away from ready.

### Bulging float (nakabukure) shape

When we have a floating tile in the middle of a run (e.g., ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) we have a **bulging float** (nakabukure) shape. Bulging float shapes are quite good at producing side-wait protoruns. Any bulging float shapes from 2334 through 6778 can accept four kinds of tiles to produce a side-wait protorun and a complete run. Take ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png), for example. It can produce a side-wait protorun and a complete run if we draw any of ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/2-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png) ). With this in mind, consider the following 2-away hand.

<div class="discard-question">What would you discard?</div>

</fieldset>

Discarding ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) to break the bulging float shape is not ideal. Although doing so increases tile acceptance temporarily, the hand will be ﬁlled with closed-wait protoruns. Alternatively, you should discard ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/8-sou.png) to maintain the bulging float shape.

That being said, when this shape remains as is when a hand is ready, it does not make for a good wait. For example, consider the following ready hand.

Discarding ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/pei.png) to keep the bulging float shape ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) makes the wait of this hand pretty bad. It is waiting for ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png), but we are already using two of it in the hand, leaving only two winning tiles. We should rather discard ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/4-man.png) to wait for ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/pei.png).

### Skipping shape

When we have a floating tile two tiles away from a run, we have a skipping shape. For example, in a shape ‌ ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png) ,‌ , ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png) is floating two tiles from a run ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-man.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png) .  ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png)‌ in a skipping shape is more valuable than isolated ‌, because it increases the kinds of tiles the hand can accept to produce a protorun or a 3-way side-wait shape. Table 3.4 summarizes all the skipping shapes and the tiles each shape can accept.

This is because ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png) is a part of a skipping shape ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/6-pin.png) ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-pin.png), but ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/3-man.png)‌ is an isolated floating tile.

As we can see in Table 3.4, skipping shapes with a terminal tile (1345 and 5679) are also valuable. The 1 of 1345 and the 9 of 5679 can accept more tiles than an isolated 2 or 8 (let alone than an isolated 1 or 9).

## Footnotes
[^13]: Standard hands are those with four groups and one head. Non-standard hands are chiitoitsu (Seven Pairs) and kokushi musou (Thirteen Orphans).


[^14]: Alternatively, we can think of these combinations as a pair plus one ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png)![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/5-man.png) + ![singletile](../../assets/image/tiles/7-man.png).
