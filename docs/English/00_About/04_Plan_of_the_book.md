# Plan of The Book

To improve your mahjong skills, you need not only to learn the theories but also to practice what you learn by playing lots of games, preferably with players who are stronger than yourself. Before the advent of online mahjong platforms, however, doing so was not very easy if you live outside of Japan.

Thanks to the recent development of online mahjong platforms, it is now feasible for you to play hundreds or thousands of games with serious opponents while living outside of Japan. On these websites, you can easily ﬁnd fellow players to play with 24/7. Most platforms keep the record of all the games players have played and a replay function that allows you to reﬂect on your past plays. You can also take a look at player statistics, which gives you important clues as to what skills you need to work on.

I thus recommend you practice mahjong skills by playing online while you study the strategy principles with this book. You do not need to wait until you ﬁnish reading everything covered in the book before you start playing. Go ahead and play games ﬁrst, then come back to the book and study the relevant parts of the book. 

This book is divided into four parts. Part I provides an introduction to an online mahjong platform called Tenhou ( 天 鳳). The website is in Japanese, but I will walk you through the account registration process and show you how to play games in [Chapter 1](../01_Introduction_to_Tenhou/01_Why_play_online.md). There already exist several excellent online resources that explain how to play Tenhou, including:

• [Arcturus’s Tenhou Documentation](https://riichi.wiki/Tenhou.net)

• [Complete Beginner’s Guide to Online Mahjong (Osamuko)](https://bit.ly/2CXAKoM)


• [Playing Online: Tenhou (Reach Mahjong of New York)](https://bit.ly/2sd0tU4)


If you have already read either of the three before, you can skip [Chapter 1](../01_Introduction_to_Tenhou/01_Why_play_online.md) of this book, for there is not much new information there for you. Chapter 2 explains some advanced features of Tenhou, which you can also skip when you read this book for the ﬁrst time.

Parts II and III are the “meat” of the book. Part II covers basic tile eﬃciency theories that allow you to maximize the speed and/or hand value of your hand. After introducing basic terminology in Chapter 3, I discuss the ﬁve-block method in Chapter 4 and provide some tips on how to pursue several yaku in Chapter 5. Part III covers strategy principles, including score calculation methods (Chapter 6), riichi judgement (Chapter 7), defense judgement (Chapter 8), melding judgement (Chapter 9), and so called “grand strategies” to win a game (Chapter 10). Finally, Appendices include a chapter on etiquettes for oﬄine playing (Chapter A) and another chapter on further readings (Chapter B).
